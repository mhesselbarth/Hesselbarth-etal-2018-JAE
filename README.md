Code repository for publication Hesselbarth et al. (2018): *Density-dependent spatial patterning of woody plants differs between a semi-arid and a mesic savanna in South Africa*, Journal of Arid Environments. 

The publication can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2018.06.002).

The R-Scripts can be divided into scripts analysing the data and scripts mainly plotting the results. All are seperated into different analyses. The separation is mainly linked to the hypotheses of the publication. All results are availaible as *.rds*-files.

The point pattern data can be requested from the [author](mailto:maximilian.hesselbarth@uni-goettingen.de?subject=Data%20request%20Hesselbarth%20et%20al.%202018).

The research took place and was founded by the IDESSA project. For more information see [here](http://www.idessa.org/).
